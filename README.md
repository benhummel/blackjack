# Blackjack

`python blackjack.py`

This is a simple command-line Blackjack game. I wrote it on a plane returning from a very unsatisfying trip to Las Vegas.

The player starts with $100 and faces off against a dealer with no other players. The player can hit, stand, or double-down. Dealer hits until 17. Insurance and splits are not yet supported.
